One of my friends suggested I make a calendar featuring some of the photos I had taken while in Geneva.  Here is the result.  She wanted me to make some mmoney from it, but I didn't the quality of the images was good enough, so instead I just made it available for free.  Future years might see a paid option.

<h3>Overview</h3>

These are twelve photos of Geneva, arranged into a calendar using Powerpoint.  I might make an application that generates a calendar automatically, importing special days if I get the time.  Large (90 MB) copy available upon request.
